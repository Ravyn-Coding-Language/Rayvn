# Rayvn Language — Roadmap

This document tracks what is currently being built, what is planned,
and what is intentionally postponed.

Rayvn is under active development and some features may change.

---

## ✅ Recently Completed

- Bytecode compiler
- Stack-based virtual machine
- Functions with parameters and return values
- `if / elseif / else` chains
- `while` loops
- `for ... in` loops
- `range(start, end, step)`
- Arrays and indexing
- Strings
- Iteration over strings, arrays, and ranges
- `break` and `continue`

---

## 🚧 Currently Working On

- Improving VM stability and error messages
- Cleaning up iterator handling
- String and number indexing consistency
- Language documentation
- Test coverage for core features
- String Escapes

---

## 🧪 Experimental / In Progress

- Short-circuit logic optimizations
- Better stack safety checks
- Cleaner function call frames
- Performance improvements in loops

---

## 🔜 Planned Features

- Standard library (math, string helpers)
- Better error reporting (line + column)
- REPL (interactive shell)
- File imports / modules
- Simplified pattern matching (maybe)
- Structs / objects (long-term)
- Classes / OOP

---

## ❌ Explicitly Not Planned (For Now)

- JIT compilation
- Type system
- Garbage collection

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Syntax may change while features stabilize
- Priority is correctness over performance
- The language is designed to stay small and understandable as of right now
